#2. you give the fath C:\Users\YODA\OneDrive\...\..

#3. you can control which code is executed if is true you executed if is false you skipped 

#4. class is like a object constructor 

#5 to build object 1 is more organized 2 you can control you build that 3 and to use polymorphism

#6 attributes are variables of a class

#7 variables that contain data and functions that can be used to manipulate the data

#8 constructor is to assign values Destructor is delete the object from the memory is auto 

#9 is word that you cannot be use as var name like  and ,or, break ... 
# and self if reference to the current instate of the class and use to access var in this class 

#10 inherits all the methods from another class

#11 methods/functions/operators with the same name that can be executed on many objects or classes
# when we have multiple classes with the same method 

#12 static method is bound to a class rather than the objects this means that a static method can
#be called without object      @static_method def....
